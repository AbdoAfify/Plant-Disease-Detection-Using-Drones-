# Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-Drones-
This project leverages computer vision and deep learning to detect plant diseases from drone-captured images, helping improve agricultural monitoring and diagnosis. The system utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify diseases in plants, with a user-friendly interface and web-based deployment.
